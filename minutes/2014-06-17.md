# Education Committee Meeting Minutes - June 17, 2014

## Attendees

- Colin Gallagher
- David Allen
- Nikos Bentenitis
- Todd Erickson

## Updates and Action Items

1. Nikos Bentenitis has forwarded the committee's [first blog post](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/blog/01-decentralization.md) to Jinyoung Englund, the director of marketing & communications at BF, for review and inclusion to the Foundation's blog. The text was also forwarded to Kevin Beardsley, the director of membership at BF, for inclusion in the 2nd-Quarter newsletter to members. 

2. Nikos has been contacted by people creating content management platforms asking if they could use the content that the committee is creating. Although the content created by the committee is free and open-source and anybody can use it as they see fit, Colin Gallagher thought that it would be ideal if a content management system could synchronize with the content that the committee has on Github and not just use a snapshot. Todd Erickson and David Allen agreed with Colin's proposal and thought that there is no need for the committee to move to another content management system. Nikos will relate this to anybody who's contacting the committee about this in the future.

3. There will be no meeting on June 24 because Nikos will be traveling. The next meeting will be on July 1 at 11 am EST time, or 5 pm Central European time.
