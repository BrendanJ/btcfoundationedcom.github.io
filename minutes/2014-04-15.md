# Updates and Action Items

1. Nikos Bentenitis updated the committee on the transition to Github. An "index" page for the committee has been created at [http://btcfoundationedcom.github.io](btcfoundationedcom.github.io). It contains links to the guides and proposals and contact information for the committee. Please sign up on Github and share your credentials with Nikos in order to be able to contribute. (It's easy to contribute by pressing the Edit button on Github). The committee discussed the use of Github issues to assign task that people can own and push forward. The "decentralization" or the committee operations is used almost synonymously for greater inclusion.

2. Colin Gallagher summarized the main points of his proposal for the principles behind the social media presence of the education committee. Please review Colin's proposal [on Github](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/proposals/socialmedia.md). It was agreed that by August 22, the social media accounts for the committee should be created and a post should be up.

3. Will Pangman discussed the status of the university relations program that he and Pamela Morgan are spearheading. Will shared a few of his observations from the recent Toronto Bitcoin conference and shared the community's interest in the college outreach programs of the committee.

4. The following meeting will take place during the day US time so that committee members from Europe might be able to participate.
