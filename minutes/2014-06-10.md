## Attendees

- Bradford Wheeler
- Nikos Bentenitis
- Sandy Ressler

## Updates and Action Items

1. Nikos Bentenitis reminded the committee members about the post to the blog of the Bitcoin Foundation. Please make any changes directly on the [Github document](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/blog/01-decentralization.md) by Friday, June 13, 2014. Jinyoung Englund, the director of Public Affairs at BF contacted Nikos and asked about the blog post itself. The members who were present thought that the post is in good shape and it should be forwarded to Jinyoung.

2. Sandy Ressler talked a bit about Jon Matonis' presentation at the Amsterdam conference about the organization. Sandy talked about the number of paid employees and the monthly expenses at the BF.

3. Bradford Wheeler introduced himself to the committee and shared his understanding about the new standards committee and about the new platform that the BF website will be based on. The standards committee will look at issues like the Unicode symbol for bitcoin (an issue that has been discussed in the committee before). The new platform for the BF website will allow open publishing and networking among BF members.
