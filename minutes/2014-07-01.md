## Updates and Action Items

1. The committee's [first blog post](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/blog/01-decentralization.md) has been forwarded to Jinyoung Englund but it has not been included in the Foundation's blog yet. Everybody present in the meeting will contact members of the Foundation to remind them of the blog post.

*Update*: Soon after the committee meeting, Jinyoung Englund emailed Nikos and told him that a blog post introducing the committee will be published during the week of July 7, 2014. Jingyoung also reminded Nikos that there will be a dedicated section on the soon-to-be-launched website of the Foundation for the committees. Nikos will be chatting with Jingyoung on July 21 at 2:30 pm Eastern Time, and will be updating the committee on the content of that meeting. 

2. John Meese, the newest member of the education committee, introduced himself to the members who were present at the meeting. John has an extensive experience with social media and will be helping Colin Gallagher and Will Pangman with the committee's social media presence. 

3. The next meeting of the education committee will take place at 10 pm Eastern Time (5 am Central European Time), on July 8.
