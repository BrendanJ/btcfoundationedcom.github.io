# Updates and Action Items

*For all the action items described below, Nikos will initiate contact with other committee members and ask for their help*

1. Promoting the guides produced by the education committee
	- Format documents with the Bitcoin Foundation logo in a PDF document 
	- Until the new website of the Foundation is up, post the guides on the education committee subforum
	- Promote the posts/guides directly through the websites of other organizations
	- Establish a social media presence, guidelines and procedures for posting information
	- Organize a webinar to promote the existing guides and to describe the projects underway

2. University relations
	- We are still waiting to hear from the board about the funding of a proposal to study the most effective way to establish relationships with universities. We should be able to find out the decision of the Board soon
	- Progress has been made in establishing relationships and networks by several student groups.

3. Rewarding members for their contributions
	- Project pages on LinkedIn can include the people who are working on a specific project of the committee
	- Potentially, ask for donations that will go directly to the education committee

4. Thank you Todd for the conference software! From now on, we will have weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 10 pm Eastern. Members who cannot participate in those meetings should be accommodated at a different time.
