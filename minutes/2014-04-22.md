## Updates and Action Items

1. Nikos Bentenitis thanked everybody for their contributions to the Github repository of the committee. Please keep up the great work. NB also suggested that membership to the committee should be on the basis of contribution and not on the basis of assignment.

2. Colin Gallagher requested that all social media access credentials should be maintained and shared in a secure way. NB suggested to contact all the committee members with those credentials, storing them and sharing them through LastPass

3. Will Pangman suggested that the Google group should be a way for newcomers to be involved in the work of the committee. As such, membership to the Google group will not require membership to the Foundation. NB will add WP as an administrator to the Google group so that he can approve new members of the Group.
