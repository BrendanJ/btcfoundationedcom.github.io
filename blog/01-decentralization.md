# Functions of the Bitcoin Foundation Education Committee

The Bitcoin Foundation's mission is to help people exchange resources and ideas more freely. We approach that mission with Bitcoinâ€™s technology and community as our focus. We believe for the most prominent results, we must work towards three primary activities; the standardization of Bitcoin, the protection of Bitcoin, and the promotion of Bitcoin.

The Education Committee, a branch of the Bitcoin Foundation, focuses on the promotion of Bitcoin. By promoting Bitcoin, we hope to clear up any public misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations of Bitcoin. If we want large scale adoption, Bitcoin must be unambiguous, the general public needs to be able to comprehend how Bitcoin works and how adoption can be beneficial to both themselves and others.

To promote Bitcoin, the Education Committee is currently focusing on developing and producing best-practice, or ease of use, guides that anyone interested in Bitcoin may turn to for information about Bitcoin, from obtaining your first wallet and Bitcoin, to all of the potential Bitcoin has for it's supporters and the future. In this blog post, we would like to share how the Education Committee proposes to open up the public to Bitcoin through the creation of guides.

The Education Committee has created a series of [guides](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/tree/master/guides) set to [introduce Bitcoin](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/guides/en/introduction.md) to those looking to learn more. We provide suggestions on selecting the [right wallet for you](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/guides/en/security.md), [buying and selling Bitcoin](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/guides/en/buying.md), using [Bitcoin in a business environment](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/guides/en/businesses.md), and information on the technical aspects of [Bitcoin for the non tech-savvy](http://btcfoundationedcom.github.io/guides/pdf/BTCHandout2NonTech.pdf). We have also listed some of our [proposals](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/tree/master/proposals) for wider adoption, such as our initiative for strong relations with [Universities](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/proposals/universities.md) and [Educational Institutions](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/proposals/universities.md), as well as our presence on [Social Media](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/proposals/socialmedia.md) in regards to expanding our reach as much as possible. These proposals will occasionally be shared with the Bitcoin Foundation board for further discussion and criticism. All materials are created with open-endedness in mind, so anyone can contribute in their own way.

With open-endedness in mind, the Education Committee will be making using of GitHub for creating, hosting and editing our content, managing past, current and future tasks, and attributing credit to our contributors. Our goal is for all Education Committee related content to be available to the public for their own general use, may it be purely informational or may it lead to their own contributions and changes.

Committee membership and standing are not determined by and single entity or group of people, rather it is determined by contributions and work toward the promotion of Bitcoin. Currently there is a chair person, Nikos Bentenitis, who is pushing this vision and encouraging participation, but the long term goal is to have decentralized content creation, in which no chair person is necessary. We understand people come and go, ideas can easily gain or lose interest, but by using GitHub nothing is lost, anyone is able to pick up someone elses idea and help make it a reality.

We invite you to look at the Education Committee's landing page (***Link in OP was broken***), our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io), our outstanding [tasks](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/issues) (listed as 'Issues' on GitHub), and our current [contributors](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/graphs/contributors). We encourage anyone interested to sign up for an account on GitHub and [contribute](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/contact/README.md) to the Education Committee's work by updating our guides, sharing them with your networks, and helping us translate guides so we can really reach out to everyone across the globe. Finally, the Education Committee invites you to join us in our expanding social media presence.
