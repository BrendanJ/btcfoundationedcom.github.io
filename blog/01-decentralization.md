# Functions of the Bitcoin Foundation Education Committee

From the three goals of the Bitcoin Foundation (standardization, protection and promotion of Bitcoin), the education committee is focused on promotion. To promote Bitcoin, the committee currently focuses on producing best-practice guides that members of the general public can turn to for information about Bitcoin and its potential. In this post, we would like to share with you how the committee is creating those guides with an eye towards its decentralization and its opening to the community.

We have created a series of [guides](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/tree/master/guides) with an [introduction to Bitcoin](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/guides/en/introduction.md), and we provide suggestions on [selecting a wallet](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/guides/en/security.md), [buying bitcoin](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/guides/en/buying.md), [using bitcoin in business](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/guides/en/businesses.md) and the [technical part of bitcoin for non-technical users](http://btcfoundationedcom.github.io/guides/BTCHandout2NonTech.pdf). You can also see a few of our [proposals](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/tree/master/proposals) that include the committee's [university relations initiative](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/proposals/universities.md) and the committee's [social media presence](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/proposals/socialmedia.md). Those proposals are made to the Board of the Foundation from time to time. All these materials are created in an open-ended way and everybody is free to participate at any time.

The committee has been using Github.com for content hosting, content generation, task management and credit attribution. The goal is for all content created by the committee to be hosted on Github, all editing to be done there, all tasks to be public and, most importantly, membership and standing in the committee to be determined by contribution. Committee membership is not determined by a decree and nobody chooses whom to appoint in the committee. There is a chair-person, currently Nikos Bentenitis, who is pushing towards this vision and is encouraging everybody to participate. But the idea is that if this experiment in decentralized content creation succeeds, there will be no need for a chair-person.People in the committee come and go, ideas gain and lose momentum but with Github everybody's work is visible to the world. 

We invite you to look at the committee's [homepage](btcfoundationedcom.github.io), [Github repository](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io), outstanding [tasks](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/issues) (called issues on Github), and current [contributors](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/graphs/contributors). And we encourage you to set up a Github account and to [contribute to the committee's work](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/contact/README.md) by updating our guides, sharing them with your network and translating them (we have done some work in Spanish and Italian but we need more languages). And finally, the committee has an expanding social media presence with members sharing the credentials of social media accounts and posting there.
