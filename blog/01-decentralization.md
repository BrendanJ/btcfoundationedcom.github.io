# The Decentralizing of the Bitcoin Foundation Education Committee



a. Unfolding Process 
The decentralized nature of the committee (referencing our favorite protocal as the guiding light)
people have come and gone, many have stayed to participate
Earliest Chair was Charles Hoskinson, then Elizabeth Ploshay and now King Nikos (humour to be removed)

b. Selecting the Tools
In the earliest incarnations there was an organic growth that led to GitHub as the tool of choice, and prepared documents were moved here and formatted.

c. The Fruits of our collective labour
The goal has always been to create items which can be used to meet the goals of the foundation.
listing of said documents, how they compliment the work of other committees and the bitcoin.org crew (we work well with others.) and the open ended nature leaves others free to participate at any time.

d. Education Committee Social media and the work being done by a few participants. Including the important task of translation.

5. Committee recommendations being made and formally presented to the board of directors. 
(which of course can lead to personal comments from each of them)
