# Building Bitcoin's Human Network - A Plan for Creating, Connecting, Educating, and Activating Campus and Community Groups 

Authors: Will Pangman, Pamela Morgan, Nikos Bentenitis

## Executive Summary

The Education Committee is seeking a grant for a three-month long, preliminary study that will identify, evaluate, and recommend necessary actions for the establishment of a comprehensive college campus outreach program.The program (official name to-be-determined) will provide students and faculty at universities in the US and abroad accessible, standardized resources that support bitcoin education and adoption. Two members of the committee, Will Pangman and Pamela Morgan (bios below) with assistance from Nikos Bentenitis will administer this project as Program Managers. The objective of the three month study is to identify and establish relationships with colleges, professors, professional organizations, student organizations, and community organizations and to reveal current gaps that the Foundation could fill. The objective of the program is to establish relationships with colleges, professors, and student organizations in order to foster concrete understanding of Bitcoin, build community, encourage inclusion of requisite materials across varied courses, and promote academic research in all applicable disciplines. Where possible, representatives of the Foundation will be present at various campus-wide and group-specific events, professional development events for educators, symposia, and other university fora, in order to conduct presentations, workshops, and perform general outreach activities. 

Many foundations actively interface with student groups and professors. In the domain of computer science for example, the Association for Computing Machinery, ACM, describes its interactions with students on its website. Our program will replicate some of the strategies exhibited by the ACM and other like foundations, while developing initiatives that follow in the spirit of Bitcoin's decentralized, distributed, open source, and disruptive nature.

At the end of the three-month period, the committee will produce a comprehensive report, identifying the work completed and a recommended course of action for the 2014-2015 academic year which begins in August 2014. 

## Statement of Need

To date, the Foundation has dedicated many resources to the legal and regulatory portions of its mission. However, for the Foundation to fulfill its mission to standardize, protect, and promote Bitcoin, it must begin teaching educators and stimulating the interest of students. 

The network effect exhibited by Bitcoin is arguably one of the most robust and impressive of its features. Of all the factors that account for the rising value of Bitcoin, spreading adoption is perhaps the only one over which current users can have direct influence. The strength of this transformative technology has been demonstrated repeatedly by its elastic resilience to PR disasters, tragic business failures, media-proliferated FUD, cyber-crime, and governmental pressures. Bitcoin however, has its weaknesses. Thanks to the embattling issues just referenced, many people have now heard of Bitcoin compared to one year ago at this time. However, the vast majority of these people have only cursory knowledge of Bitcoin at best, which portends their acceptance of the equally nescient viewpoints being disseminated from traditionally ubiquitous sources of information, i.e. the mainstream media and governmental authorities.

Up to this point, new interest in Bitcoin had come mostly from people familiar with alternative viewpoints regarding computer technology, economics, and money. These people are comfortable teaching themselves by poring through forum posts, wikis, and other sources that consist of imposing walls of text. For full scale, widespread adoption of Bitcoin across the mainstream, this will not do. 

Making Bitcoin accessible to students and professors requires an overhaul in the way people view money, property, and trust, not to mention digital security. To adequately meet the needs of these prospective new users, an "offline", personal touch is required. Meetups and conferences have provided this so far, but have had difficulties given the misconceptions about Bitcoin that continue to permeate. In addition, meetups lack resources and credibility and conferences lack accessibility. As a result meetups and conferences are mainly reaching ideological and industry insiders. Our program overcomes these problems through direct involvement in the part of society that is most open to experimentation with novel and profound ideas: academia. 

If the constant media attention over the past three months is any indication, Bitcoin's watershed moment is now at hand. For the masses to readily grasp the profound potential of Bitcoin, the process of understanding it must become more palatable, more available, and more tangible for the average Internet user. To serve this function is the perfect role for the Bitcoin Foundation Education Committee, and a welcome sight for everyone, both inside the Bitcoin community and out, on an otherwise tenuous and often hostile landscape.

## Goals and Objectives

The program will support relationship building with existing student and faculty organizations, it will identify best practices and it will generate ideas on how to foster and support these organizations. Preliminary ideas are discussed below, however these ideas need validation through discussion and preliminary implementation with the organizations (schools/students/faculty) who have been identified for inclusion. At the end of the three-month period, we will submit a comprehensive report to the board outlining strategy for the next year and beyond. 


### Ways to establish relations with student organizations

The value of educating the younger generation about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be overstated. In addition to preparing students to live in a world where the use of cryptocurrencies will be common, such an education will enable students to establish a university-wide dialog. There are several ways by which the Foundation can foster and develop such relations. For example, it can

- Develop and foster new bitcoin-specific student groups on campuses in the US and abroad, and interconnect them through an online portal. 
- Tap pre-existing student organizations that are bitcoin-friendly and support them through an affiliation with the Foundation.
- Create a network of qualified speakers that students can invite to campus for presentations.
- Create a media and education kit that any student organization can offer to its members. The Appendix describes some ideas for a student outreach event that an affiliated student organization could run.
- Give awards to the most active student organizations, such as scholarships  for students to attend Bitcoin conferences.
- Establish a presence (information booth) during campus events such as freshman orientation week, homecoming, March of Dimes, Earth Day, business incubator events, etc.
- Develop a decentralized national student organization, initially guided by the Foundation and others, with a goal of reaching self-organizing, distributed autonomy within three years.

### Ways to establish relations with university professors

Research in the cryptocurrency space covers areas as diverse as computer science, computational science, engineering, financial literacy, business, marketing, and even sociology. When research universities start supporting research in the space, the rate of innovation will increase and Bitcoin will benefit. There are several ways by which the Foundation can foster and develop such relations. For example, it can

- Offer scholarships to professors who are interested in participating in Bitcoin conferences and are willing to start a course in cryptocurrencies on their campus.
- Sponsor or co-publish an open-access, peer-reviewed journal where professors can publish their research and receive credit for promotion and tenure.
- Support existing and future academic conferences to include Bitcoin and possibly other cryptocurrencies.
- Establish a roster of Ambassadors that colleges, professors, and students can bring to campus as speakers, guest lecturers, professional development counselors, etc.
- Create a class module that can be included in a variety of courses including economics, sociology, philosophy, finance, business, entrepreneurship, computer science, law, etc.
- Create a course curriculum for continuing education.
- Establish formal relationships with professional organizations whose members are university professors.
- Create a research module that could be used in connection with the student-outreach event described in the Appendix. 

## Methodology

While we believe all of the above goals are worthy of immediate action, some could be implemented in the short-term with little investment while others will require a more significant dedication of time and effort. In order to evaluate which of the ideas should be pursued, we will conduct a three-month micro-experiment which will provide data to inform a longer-term implementation plan for Summer 2014 and the 2014-2015 Academic Year. 

**March-May 2014**: Two to three (2-3) members of the education committee (Program Managers) spend approximately 15-25 hours per week on research relating to this project. During this time, each Program Manager will reach out to colleges to identify interest and feasibility of the suggestions above. The research will be documented on a shared spreadsheet and will include contact information, important dates, and receptivity to the ideas above. New ideas generated from the research will be included in the document as well. Additionally, Program Managers will seek to conduct information sessions for faculty and students when possible in order to gauge content and level of interest. During this three-month phase, Program Managers will provide updates to the entire Education Committee during the regularly scheduled meetings.

**June 2014**: The Program Managers will compile a report of the findings and a comprehensive outreach strategy for Summer 2014 and the 2014-15 academic year, present it to the Education Committee, who will then present it to the Board for consideration. The report will include contact information for students and professors identified during the study, an analysis of the current state of adoption in college campuses worldwide, and a detailed action plan for moving forward written so that the Foundation may implement the entire plan or select independent parts as the Education Committee and Foundation see fit. 

**July 2014 - May 2015**: The Education Committee and the Foundation will implement part or all of the action plan developed during the fact-finding phase. Another funding request will be submitted based upon feedback from the June 2014 report. The request will be consistent with portions of the action plan recommended by the committee. 

## Estimated Costs and Budget

### Research study

**Dates**: March 15, 2014  - June 30, 2014 

**Cost Estimate**: $12,000 - $20,000 USD equivalent, payable in Bitcoin. 

- Program Managers (stipend/each):  $6,000 USD, paid in Bitcoin, in three installments. Two or three program managers should be actively participating, though one or more could be on an advisory basis with a reduced stipend. Will Pangman and Pamela Morgan (bios below) have agreed to act as program managers. Nikos Bentenitis will act as an unpaid advisor. 
- Travel / Conference  Reimbursement (if necessary): The cost will not exceed $2,000 USD per Program Manager without approval. We expect these costs to be minimal with the exception of a presentation at Bitcoin 2014 in May 2014. During the conference the interim findings will be presented and the global audience will be invited to participate. 
- Marketing Materials: for students and professors. Not to exceed $3,000 USD total without approval. 

### Long-Term project

The cost will be estimated in the June report. The Board will be provided with a number of fundable options that can be executed by the Foundation as a whole, the Education Committee in particular, or by individuals.

## Appendix

### Example student-outreach event

During a student-outreach event, the Program Manager can give students wallets that contain a small fraction of bitcoin. Students will then learn that they can either keep all their bitcoins or, give them to others, or donate some or all of them to a favorite charity. The benefits of such an activity for the students would include them becoming aware that bitcoin is a currency and that it can be used for a good cause (donations). At the same time, a psychology, sociology or economics student could collect data on how the fractions of the bitcoin were spent and interview the participants about their motivations. Possibly, the same structure could be used to establish a competition among universities for the greatest amount donated to charity.
